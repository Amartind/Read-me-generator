## Installation (#installation)
    
You will need to have these dependancies installed by running:
npm install
    
## Usage (#usage)
    
    
First you need to have the dependencies installed and then you can open up the terminal and run index.js(this files name) with node and you should be then prompted with a series of questions which when complete will provide a almost full readme file with the need to insert pictures/videos for each project.

To add a screenshot, create an 'assets/images'folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    
    '''md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
